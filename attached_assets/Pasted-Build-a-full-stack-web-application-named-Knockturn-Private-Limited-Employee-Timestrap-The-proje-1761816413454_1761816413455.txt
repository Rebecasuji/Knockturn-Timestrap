Build a full-stack web application named “Knockturn Private Limited — Employee Timestrap”.
The project should include a frontend (React + Vite) and a backend (Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL).

The application must have the following features and design elements:

🌙 Login Page (with GSAP Lamp Animation)

A modern lamp animation using GSAP. When the user pulls the lamp thread, it should glow outside the box and then navigate to the next page.

The login page should have fields for:

Employee ID

Employee Name

When the lamp is pulled, verify the user by connecting to PostgreSQL:

If the employee doesn’t exist, create a new one.

Then navigate to the tracker page.

Page aesthetic: black and blue color theme with glowing lamp effects for a professional and futuristic appearance.

🕒 Employee Tracker / Timesheet Page (TrackerPage.tsx)

Automatically display:

Current date and live time.

Employee name and ID from login.

Include a task tracker section where employees can:

Add a new task (with start and end time auto-generated).

Each task should have a Complete button.

Automatically calculate total working time as tasks are completed.

A Final Submit button to submit the day’s timesheet.

Save all data (tasks, start/end time, total worked hours) in PostgreSQL.

📊 Charts & Analytics Section

Integrate Chart.js (via react-chartjs-2) to display:

Doughnut chart: Work vs Break hours.

Bar chart: Task-wise total hours.

Progress chart: Productivity over the day.

Data for charts should come from the employee’s timesheet and task data stored in PostgreSQL.

🧠 Backend Requirements

Node.js + Express server with REST APIs:

/api/login → Login or register employee.

/api/employees/:id/timesheet → Fetch or create a timesheet.

/api/tasks → Add, complete, or update tasks.

/api/submit → Submit the timesheet and calculate total work time.

Store all records in PostgreSQL with these tables:

employees (id, employee_id, name)

timesheets (id, employee_id, date, total_work_seconds)

tasks (id, timesheet_id, title, start_time, end_time, duration_seconds, is_complete)

💾 Database

Use PostgreSQL as the backend database.

Automatically create timesheet and task entries for each employee per day.

🎨 Design & Theme

Theme: Black background with electric blue highlights.

Components should have soft blue glows and rounded corners for a premium tech look.

Include smooth animations for buttons, transitions between pages, and glowing chart cards.
